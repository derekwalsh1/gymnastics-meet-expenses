        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 7, 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Gymnastics Meet Expenses ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
            This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Gymnastics Meet Expenses is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, 
            transmit, store, or share any of your personal or financial information. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal identification information</li>
            <li>We do not collect financial data or expense information</li>
            <li>We do not track your location</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
            <li>We do not share any data with third parties</li>
            <li>We do not display advertisements</li>
            <li>We do not require account creation or login</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All information you enter into Gymnastics Meet Expenses is stored locally on your device only. 
            This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event information</li>
            <li>Expense records</li>
            <li>Judge assignments</li>
            <li>Association details</li>
            <li>Any photos or receipts you attach</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it using the app's 
            export and sharing features (PDF generation, email sharing, etc.). These actions are entirely 
            under your control.
        </p>
        
        <h2>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h2>
        <p>
            If you choose to enable iCloud backup on your device, your app data may be included in your 
            personal iCloud backup. This backup is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted by Apple</li>
            <li>Stored in your personal iCloud account</li>
            <li>Controlled entirely by you through your Apple ID settings</li>
            <li>Not accessible to us</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>
            The app requests access to your photo library solely to allow you to attach receipt images 
            to your expense records. This permission is optional and only used when you choose to add 
            photos. We do not access, store, or transmit any photos beyond what you explicitly select 
            and attach to your expense records.
        </p>
        
        <h2>No Account Required</h2>
        <p>
            Gymnastics Meet Expenses does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, 
            or share any personal information to use the app.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app 
            can be safely used by individuals of all ages.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page 
            with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since all your data is stored locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have complete control over your data</li>
            <li>You can delete all data by uninstalling the app</li>
            <li>You can export your data at any time using the app's PDF export features</li>
            <li>There is no data for us to access, modify, or delete on our end</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Gymnastics Meet Expenses does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, 
            or advertising networks. The app operates entirely offline and independently.
